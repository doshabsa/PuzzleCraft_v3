         I was unable to get transparency working with tokens, which stopped map/wold building pretty quickly.

        Despite not making maps, I find the overall reduction of code usage insane. Far fewer lines than the original, with
        incredible ease of inserting new items, monsters, or potential characters. 

        If token transparency can be corrected, the addition of maps would leave only crafting and questing to be implemented.
